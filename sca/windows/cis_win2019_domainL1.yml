# 1.1.2 Maximum password age (Scored)
  - id: 15000 
    title: "Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '60 or fewer days, but not 0'"
    description: "This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current. The recommended state for this setting is 60 or fewer days, but not 0."
    rationale: "The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user is authorized access."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 60 or fewer days, but not 0: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Password Policy\\Maximum password age."

# 2.3.1.2 Accounts: Block Microsoft accounts (Scored)
  - id: 15001 
    title: "Ensure 'Accounts: Block Microsoft accounts' is set to 'Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts"
    description: "This policy setting prevents users from adding new Microsoft accounts on this computer. The recommended state for this setting is: Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts."
    rationale: "Organizations that want to effectively implement identity management policies and maintain firm control of what accounts are used to log onto their computers will probably want to block Microsoft accounts. Organizations may also need to block Microsoft accounts in order to meet the requirements of compliance standards that apply to their information systems."

  - id: 15002 
    title: "Ensure 'Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only' is set to 'Enabled'"
    description: "This policy setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If you enable this policy setting, local accounts that have blank passwords will not be able to log on to the network from remote client computers. Such accounts will only be able to log on at the keyboard of the computer. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden through both organizational policy and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domainbased password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For example, a user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected accounts could then use it to log on."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only."

# 2.3.2.1 Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings (Scored)
  - id: 15003 
    title: "Ensure 'Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings' is set to 'Enabled'"
    description: "This policy setting allows administrators to enable the more precise auditing capabilities present in Windows Vista. The Audit Policy settings available in Windows Server 2003 Active Directory do not yet contain settings for managing the new auditing subcategories. To properly apply the auditing policies prescribed in this baseline, the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings setting needs to be configured to Enabled. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. *Important*: Be very cautious about audit settings that can generate a large volume of traffic. For example, if you enable either success or failure auditing for all of the Privilege Use subcategories, the high volume of audit events generated can make it difficult to find other types of entries in the Security log. Such a configuration could also have a significant impact on system performance."
    rationale: "Prior to the introduction of auditing subcategories in Windows Vista, it was difficult to track events at a per-system or per-user level. The larger event categories created too many events and the key information that needed to be audited was difficult to find."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings."

# 2.3.2.2 Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits (Scored)
  - id: 15004 
    title: "Ensure 'Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits' is set to 'Disabled'"
    description: "This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "If the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or important troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security incident. Also, an attacker could potentially generate a large volume of Security log events to purposely force a computer shutdown."

    description: "This policy setting determines who is allowed to format and eject removable NTFS media. You can use this policy setting to prevent unauthorized users from removing data on one computer to access it on another computer on which they have local administrator privileges. The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators."
    rationale: "Users may be able to move data on removable disks to a different computer where they have administrative privileges. The user could then take ownership of any file, grant themselves full control, and view or modify any file. The fact that most removable storage devices will eject media by pressing a mechanical button diminishes the advantage of this policy setting."

    title: "Ensure 'Devices: Prevent users from installing printer drivers' is set to 'Enabled'"
    description: "For a computer to print to a shared printer, the driver for that shared printer must be installed on the local computer. This security setting determines who is allowed to install a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. Note: This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer. This setting does not affect Administrators."
    rationale: "It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations. However, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do so on servers, because printer driver installation on a server may unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your computer network."

# 2.3.5.1 Domain controller: Allow server operators to schedule tasks (Scored)
  - id: 15007 
    title: "Ensure 'Domain controller: Allow server operators to schedule tasks' is set to 'Disabled' (DC only)"
    description: "This policy setting determines whether members of the Server Operators group are allowed to submit jobs by means of the AT schedule facility. The impact of this policy setting configuration should be small for most organizations. Users, including those in the Server Operators group, will still be able to create jobs by means of the Task Scheduler Wizard, but those jobs will run in the context of the account with which the user authenticates when they set up the job. Note: An AT Service Account can be modified to select a different account rather than the LOCAL SYSTEM account. To change the account, open System Tools, click Scheduled Tasks, and then click Accessories folder. Then click AT Service Account on the Advanced menu. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "If you enable this policy setting, jobs that are created by server operators by means of the AT service will execute in the context of the account that runs that service. By default, that is the local SYSTEM account. If you enable this policy setting, server operators could perform tasks that SYSTEM is able to do but that they would typically not be able to do, such as add their account to the local Administrators group."

# 2.3.5.2 Domain controller: LDAP server signing requirements (Scored)
  - id: 15008 
    title: "Ensure 'Domain controller: LDAP server signing requirements' is set to 'Require signing' (DC only)"
    description: "This policy setting determines whether the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server requires LDAP clients to negotiate data signing. The recommended state for this setting is: Require signing. Note: Domain member computers must have Network security: LDAP signing requirements (Rule 2.3.11.8) set to Negotiate signing or higher. If not, they will fail to authenticate once the above Require signing value is configured on the Domain Controllers. Fortunately, Negotiate signing is the default in the client configuration. Note #2: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind (ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No Microsoft LDAP clients that are shipped with Windows XP Professional use LDAP simple bind or LDAP simple bind through SSL to talk to a Domain Controller. Note #3: Before enabling this setting, you should first ensure that there are no clients (including server-based applications) that are configured to authenticate with Active Directory via unsigned LDAP, because changing this setting will break those applications. Such applications should first be reconfigured to use signed LDAP, Secure LDAP (LDAPS), or IPsec-protected connections."
    rationale: "Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. In such attacks, an intruder captures packets between the server and the client, modifies them, and then forwards them to the client. Where LDAP servers are concerned, an attacker could cause a client to make decisions that are based on false records from the LDAP directory. To lower the risk of such an intrusion in an organization's network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you could implement Internet Protocol security (IPsec) authentication header mode (AH), which performs mutual authentication and packet integrity for IP traffic to make all types of man- in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult. Additionally, allowing the use of regular, unsigned LDAP permits credentials to be received over the network in clear text, which could very easily result in the interception of account passwords by other systems on the network."

  - id: 15014 
    title: "Ensure 'Domain member: Require strong (Windows 2000 or later) session key' is set to 'Enabled'"
    description: "When this policy setting is enabled, a secure channel can only be established with Domain Controllers that are capable of encrypting secure channel data with a strong (128-bit) session key. To enable this policy setting, all Domain Controllers in the domain must be able to encrypt secure channel data with a strong key, which means all Domain Controllers must be running Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "Session keys that are used to establish secure channel communications between Domain Controllers and member computers are much stronger in Windows 2000 than they were in previous Microsoft operating systems.

With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U. When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.

  - id: 15043 
    title: "Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM'"
    description: "LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations: -Join a domain -Authenticate between Active Directory forests -Authenticate to down-level domains -Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP -Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain. The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers. The recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM."
    rationale: "Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non- R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible."

    rationale: "Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards them to the server. For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means of IPsec authentication headers."

To address this risk, in Windows Vista and newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two ways: - If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator. - If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created.

    title: "Ensure 'Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received' is set to 'Enabled: Semi-Annual Channel, 180 or more days'"
    description: "This policy setting determines the level of Preview Build or Feature Updates to receive, and when. The Windows readiness level for each new Windows 10 Feature Update is classified in one of 5 categories, depending on your organizations level of comfort with receiving them: Preview Build - Fast: Devices set to this level will be the first to receive new builds of Windows with features not yet available to the general public. Select Fast to participate in identifying and reporting issues to Microsoft, and provide suggestions on new functionality. Preview Build - Slow: Devices set to this level receive new builds of Windows before they are available to the general public, but at a slower cadence than those set to Fast, and with changes and fixes identified in earlier builds. Release Preview: Receive builds of Windows just before Microsoft releases them to the general public. Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted): Receive feature updates when they are released to the general public. Semi-Annual Channel: Feature updates will arrive when they are declared Semi-Annual Channel. This usually occurs about 4 months after Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted), indicating that Microsoft, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), partners and customer believe that the release is ready for broad deployment. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Semi-Annual Channel, 180 or more days . Note: If the \"Allow Telemetry\" policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect. Note #2: Starting with Windows Server 2016 RTM (Release 1607), Microsoft introduced a new Windows Update (WU) client behavior called Dual Scan, with an eye to cloud-based update management. In some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows Updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If you are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting to Not Configured or configure the setting Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update (added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. Note #3: Prior to Windows Server 2016 R1709, values above 180 days are not recognized by the OS. Starting with Windows Server 2016 R1709, the maximum number of days you can defer is 365 days."  
    rationale: "Forcing new features without prior testing in your environment could cause software incompatibilities as well as introducing new bugs into the operating system. In an enterprise managed environment, it is generally preferred to delay Feature Updates until thorough testing and a deployment plan is in place. This recommendation delays the automatic installation of new features as long as possible."
