# 18.9.85.3 Ensure 'Prevent Internet Explorer security prompt for Windows Installer scripts' is set to 'Disabled'
  - id: 15536 
    title: "Ensure 'Prevent Internet Explorer security prompt for Windows Installer scripts' is set to 'Disabled'"
    description: "This policy setting controls whether Web-based programs are allowed to install software on the computer without notifying the user. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "Suppressing the system warning can pose a security risk and increase the attack surface on the system."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows Installer\\Prevent Internet Explorer security prompt for Windows Installer scripts. Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates. Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially named Disable IE security prompt for Windows Installer scripts, but it was renamed starting with the Windows 8.0 & Server 2012 (non-R2) Administrative Templates."

# 18.9.97.2.2 Ensure 'Allow remote server management through WinRM' is set to 'Disabled'
  - id: 15537 
    title: "Ensure 'Allow remote server management through WinRM' is set to 'Disabled'"
    description: "This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service automatically listens on the network for requests on the HTTP transport over the default HTTP port. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "Any feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network connections are particularly risky. Only enable the use of the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service on trusted networks and when feasible employ additional controls such as IPsec."

# 18.9.98.1 Ensure 'Allow Remote Shell Access' is set to 'Disabled'
  - id: 15538 
    title: "Ensure 'Allow Remote Shell Access' is set to 'Disabled'"
    description: "This policy setting allows you to manage configuration of remote access to all supported shells to execute scripts and commands. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. Note: The GPME help text for this setting is incorrectly worded, implying that configuring it to Enabled will reject new Remote Shell connections, and setting it to Disabled will allow Remote Shell connections. The opposite is true (and is consistent with the title of the setting). This is a wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative Template."
    rationale: "Any feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network connections are particularly risky. Only enable the use of the Windows Remote Shell on trusted networks and when feasible employ additional controls such as IPsec."
