# 1.1.x Filesystem Configuration
  - id: 3005
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured"
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    remediation: "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. Example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 or Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: systemctl unmask tmp.mount systemctl enable tmp.mount Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount"

    description: "sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. The invoking user's real (not effective) user ID is used to determine the user name with which to query the security policy."
    rationale: "sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging. Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end. The default security policy is sudoers, which is configured via the file /etc/sudoers. The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run sudo. The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism. If authentication is required, sudo will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific."

    title: "Ensure core dumps are restricted"
    description: "A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user."
    rationale: "Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from dumping core."
    remediation: "Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf or a /etc/security/limits.d/* file: * hard core 0 Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file: fs.suid_dumpable = 0 Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter: # sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0"

    title: "Ensure XD/NX support is enabled"
    description: "Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature."
    rationale: "Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security of the system."
    remediation: "On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit systems: If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system. You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios."

In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group \"systemd- timesync\" needs to be created on installation of systemd. Note: The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not covered by systemd-timesyncd.

  - id: 3150
    title: "Ensure source routed packets are not accepted"
    description: "In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used."
    rationale: "Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route, net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route, net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route and net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing."

    rationale: Setting these flags is a good way to deter attackers from sending your system bogus packets that cannot be responded to.

    description: "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue."
    rationale: "Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake.

# 5.2.16 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured (Scored)
  - id: 3083
    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured"
    description: "The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening. While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be sent."

    rationale: "Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo, whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program."
    remediation: "1) Add the following line to the /etc/pam.d/su file: auth required pam_wheel.so 2) Create a comma separated list of users in the sudo statement in the /etc/group file: sudo:x:10:root,<user list> Notes: The use_uid option to pam_wheel.so is a no-op on debian based systems. It is acceptable but not required as these systems use its behavior as default."
