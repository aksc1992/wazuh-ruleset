# 1.1.1.8 FAT: filesystem
  - id: 5007 
    title: "Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is disabled"
    description: "The FAT filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB drives or flash modules. It comes in three types FAT12 , FAT16 , and FAT32 all of which are supported by the vfat kernel module."
    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
    remediation: "Edit or create the file /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf and add the following line: install vfat /bin/true. Run the following command to unload the vfat module: rmmod vfat"

# 1.1.2 /tmp: partition
  - id: 5008 
    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /tmp"
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /tmp. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

  - id: 5707 
    title: "Disable the rhnsd Daemon"
    description: "The rhnsd daemon polls the Red Hat Network web site for scheduled actions and, if there are, executes those actions."
    rationale: "Patch management policies may require that organizations test the impact of a patch before it is deployed in a production environment. Having patches automatically deployed could have a negative impact on the environment. It is best to not allow an action by default but only after appropriate consideration has been made. It is recommended that the service be disabled unless the risk is understood and accepted or you are running your own satellite .

System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media.

# 4.1.17 Ensure kernel module loading and unloading is collected (Scored)
  - id: 5126 
    title: "Ensure kernel module loading and unloading is collected"
    description: "Monitor the loading and unloading of kernel modules. The programs insmod (install a kernel module), rmmod (remove a kernel module), and modprobe (a more sophisticated program to load and unload modules, as well as some other features) control loading and unloading of modules. The init_module (load a module) and delete_module (delete a module) system calls control loading and unloading of modules. Any execution of the loading and unloading module programs and system calls will trigger an audit record with an identifier of \"modules\"."
    rationale: "Monitoring the use of insmod , rmmod and modprobe could provide system administrators with evidence that an unauthorized user loaded or unloaded a kernel module, possibly compromising the security of the system. Monitoring of the init_module and delete_module system calls would reflect an unauthorized user attempting to use a different program to load and unload modules."

# 4.1.18 Ensure the audit configuration is immutable (Scored)
  - id: 5127 
    title: "Ensure the audit configuration is immutable"
    description: "Set system audit so that audit rules cannot be modified with auditctl . Setting the flag \"-e 2\" forces audit to be put in immutable mode. Audit changes can only be made on system reboot."
    rationale: "In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit system to potentially hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules back. Users would most likely notice a system reboot and that could alert administrators of an attempt to make unauthorized audit changes."

    description: "The default TMOUT determines the shell timeout for users. The TMOUT value is measured in seconds."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a shell could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's shell session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/bashrc and /etc/profile files (and the appropriate files for any other shell supported on your system) and add or edit any umask parameters as follows: TMOUT=600"
